# CPPS
This is the 42 school introduction to C++, through a series of modules very much designed like the Piscine.
We start by learning about the new standart c++ libraries functions in C++98, then we learn about constructors and destructors ending in a deep dive into concepts like INHERITANCE and POLYMORPHISM.
